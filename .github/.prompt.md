Write a `./git-stack.ts` TypeScript script that implements a simple Git commit stack manager.

The script should allow users to:

- maintain a list of ordered "named" commits
- print the list of named commits
- add the current staged changes in git to a commit by name
- fetch the latest `origin/main` and rebase the stack on top, if merge conflicts arise, the user should be able to fix them and continue
- update the series of commits to `blebbit/main` (origin/branch)


The initial named commits are: (from bottom up, as they would be applied in git)

- blebbit-extra
- pds-private-data
- atproto-utils
- lexicon
- copilot-instructions
